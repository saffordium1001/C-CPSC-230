// * Battleships!!!
//
// * C++ Implementation of the Game 'Battleships' for the final project for
// * for CPSC 230.
//
// * This project is based on the game Battleship (termed 'Battleships' here to avoid
// * issues with infringement). The game in its current state is a human vs CPU game where the objective of
// * the user is to sink the CPU's fleet after placing their fleet (randomly or manually). The game ends if
// * the player quits, wins, or loses.
// * The AI for the CPU had to be randomly generated based on inspiration from various texbooks and
// * algorithms which were accessible. These are referenced within the subject matter report.
// *
// * This program utilizes various subject matter, criteria, and tools taught in CPSC 230.
